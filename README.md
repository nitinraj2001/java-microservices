Here are following microservices that we are going to develop:- 
1. #Product Service:- Create and view products, act as product catalog.
2. #Order Service:- can order products.
3. #Inventory service:- check if product is in stock or not.
4. #Notification Service:- can send notification after product is order.

note:- These services will interact with each other through synchronous and Asynchronous communication.
